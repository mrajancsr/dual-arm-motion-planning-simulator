# ü¶æ Interactive Dual-Arm Motion Planning Simulator for Planar Robot Arms

A Python-based simulator that models and visualizes two planar 2R robot arms performing motion planning in obstacle-rich environments.  
This project demonstrates fundamental robotics principles including forward/inverse kinematics, configuration space visualization, and sampling-based motion planning (RRT).

## üß† Project Overview

This simulator is developed for the **Computational Robotics** course (Fall 2025).  
It provides an interactive environment for understanding how dual-arm manipulators compute and execute collision-free trajectories in a shared workspace.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- Forward and Inverse Kinematics for 2-link planar arms  
- Dual-arm configuration and independent motion control  
- Workspace and C-space (configuration space) visualization  
- Sampling-based motion planning (RRT)  
- Optional trajectory smoothing and animation
